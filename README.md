# BVB-ticket-bot
Simple bot used to automatically buy tickets fromt he bvb ticket shop.
This bot will always prefer standing places as they are cheaper and will always be bought as single tickets.
If there are not standing places available, it will search for seats with the number of seats set in line 16. When there are multiple possible seats,
seats towards the middle of the stadion will be prefered.

## Usage
Set the number of seats in the `bot.py` and run the script. Firefox needs to be installed.
